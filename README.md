# Surfs up!

## Overview:
For this analysis, our team was approached by a customer interested in opening up a surf & ice-cream ship in Oahu.
The customer was specifically interested in the statistical breakdown of temperature in the area to help make a more informed decision on the potential market.
For a simplified breakdown, the CX asked for summaries specifically aimed at June & December historic.


## Results:
- June vs December comparison
  - June logically has a higher overall max and average temperatures compared to December, with June maxing out at 85* and December 83*.
  - December temperature had a minimum temp of 56*, a full 8* delta when compare to Junes 64* low.
  - June and December have little temperature variance. The average temp in December is 71* compared to Junes 75*.
  - December has slightly more variation in temperature compared to June, with a standard deviation of 3.7 vs 3.26.

## Summary:
- This analysis on temperature in Oahu shows that although Decembers temp has risk of hitting low temperature of 56*, the standard deviation of 3.7 combined with mean of 71* shows that these 56* days aren't very common. It appears that Oahu would be a good location for a Surf & Ice-cream shop.
